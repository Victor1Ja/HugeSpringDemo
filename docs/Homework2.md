# Requirements & Constraints:

The task is to create a simple web application using Spring Boot.
The application should expose a GET endpoint at "/v1/student/name" with a query parameter "formal".
If the "formal" parameter is set to false, the endpoint should return the first name.
If the "formal" parameter is set to true, the endpoint should return the full name.
## Estimation:
Time estimated is 1 hour because the task is simple and it will reuse the existing project from the previous homework and the implementation is straightforward.
Actual Time Spent:
Was 30 minutes to implement the solution.
